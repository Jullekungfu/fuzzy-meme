3:

*
  Confidentiality -  Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.
  Integrity - Prevent unauthorized modification of information.
  Availability - Prevent unauthorized with-holding of information and resources.
  Authentication - Act of confirming the truth of an entity, i.e. person/program.
  Nonrepudiation - A way to guarantee that a sender/reciever cannot deny having sent/receieved a message.
  Accountability - Users affecting security are held responsible.
  
*
  Data - Physical phenomena
  Information - What we assign to data
    Data is used to transit and store information.
    
4:

*
  Spoofing - A way to obtain password. Used when user does not authenticate system.
  E.g. false login screen.
  
*
  Brute force - Go through all possible passwords.
  Dictionary - Passwords are often based on words. Normal passwords stored in dictionaries.
  Time-Memory Tradeoff (TM TO) - In a way brute force. 
    Preprocessing phase, calculate hashes for number of passwords.
    Realtime phase, find hash in table, go to starting point -> password.
    
*
  Time-Memory Tradeoff - Pick password, calculate several reductions of hashes. Save start and end in table.
    T=t² P=N M=mt N=mt² -> N²=M²T P=N
    
*
  Rainbow tables - Improvement of TM TO. Use different reduction funtion for each computation. Fewer collisionchains. One table. Used when hash is known.
  
*
  Salts - Adds uniqueness to passwordhash
  
*
  Help from system - 
    Password checkers.
    Automatic password generation.
    Limit password time
    Limit Login attempts
    Show audit information
    
*
  Biometric systems - System that uses biological login information.
    FRR - False rejection rate
    FAR - False acceptance rate
    ERR - Equal error rate
    ERR -> FAR=FRR
    
5:

*
  Discretionary access control - The owner of an object decides the rights.
  Mandatory access control - The system decides the rights.
  
*
  Capabilities - List rights from user perspective
    Ex. Alice: A read, B read, C write.
    
  Access control list (ACL) - List rights from file perspective.
    Ex. A.txt: Alice read, Bob read.
    
*
  Powersets in access control - P(x) is the set of all the subsets in x, partial ordering. TODO NOT DONE!!
  
*
  Lattices - Graphical representation os a partially ordered set.
    Least upper bound u: a={x} b={y} u= {x,y}
    Greatest lower bound l: a={x,y} b={x,z} l={x}
    
*
  Reference monitor - Abstract machinery that controls all access to objects.
  Security kernel - The hardware, software etc. that implements the reference monitor concept.
  Trusted computing base (TCB) - The set of all protection mechanisms enforcing a security policy.

*
  Reference monitor:

  A: Requests access
  B: Checks if subject has right to access object
  C: Writes to audit 
  D: Grants/Denies access
  
  
*
  Controlled invocation
    User wants to execute an operation requiring supervisor mode.
    Switch modes.
    System performs predefined sets of operations, returns to user mode, and gives back control.
    
*
  UID Unix:
    Real - ID of logged in principal, can only be changed by root -> How login works.
    Effective - ID used for access control. Root can change to anything. Anyone can change to real.
    
*
