4:

*
  Spoofing - A way to obtain password. Used when user does not authenticate system.
  E.g. false login screen.
  
*
  Brute force - Go through all possible passwords.
  Dictionary - Passwords are often based on words. Normal passwords stored in dictionaries.
  Time-Memory Tradeoff (TM TO) - In a way brute force. 
    Preprocessing phase, calculate hashes for number of passwords.
    Realtime phase, find hash in table, go to starting point -> password.
    
*
  Time-Memory Tradeoff - Pick password, calculate several reductions of hashes. Save start and end in table.
    T=t² P=N M=mt N=mt² -> N²=M²T P=N
    
*
  Rainbow tables - Improvement of TM TO. Use different reduction funtion for each computation. Fewer collisionchains. One table. Used when hash is known.

  C: Writes to audit 
  D: Grants/Denies access
  
  
*
  Controlled invocation
    User wants to execute an operation requiring supervisor mode.
    Switch modes.
    System performs predefined sets of operations, returns to user mode, and gives back control.
    
*
  UID Unix:
    Real - ID of logged in principal, can only be changed by root -> How login works.
    Effective - ID used for access control. Root can change to anything. Anyone can change to real.

*
  Shadow file - Save password in non-world readable file. Hide hashes.
    Username
    Hashed passwords
    Date of last change
    Min days between password change
    Max valid days
    Days in advance to warn about user change
    Days account is active after password expire
    Date of account disabling
    -Last entry is reserved-
    
*
  Access control in Unix - Discretionary access control, owner of file can change permissions.
    User - Group - Other
    Read - Write - Executable
    
    Read = List Directory.
    Write = Delete, rename & insert files in directory.
    Executable = Access directory ans access files in directory.
    
    CHMOD for changes (CHMOD 111 file.txt)
    
*
  Setuid - Set user ID, Used to temporarily change access rights.
  
*
  Inode - Stores file information. ls -i gives files with inode pointers
    Stat file gives detailed inode information.
    Size          Inode number
    Access rights
    Last access
    Last modification of file
    Last modification of inode
    
*
  UMASK - Default access rights.
    Control default permissions.
    UMASK tells which permissions to exclude by default.
    Opposite of CHMOD.
    
*
  Searchpaths - When executing programs, system needs to know where to look -> PATH
    PATH=.:$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin.
    Trojan horse, if found first, executed instead of program.
    Current directory in searchpath, bad if executed by root.
    
*
  Hosts.Allow/Hosts.Deny - Files containing pairs to determine Allowed or Denied network access.
  Check Allow -> Check Deny -> Allow
  
8:

*
  LM & NTLM
    Problem w/ LM:
      DES is a fast block cipher
      No salt
      Security does not increase after 7 chars
      No lowercase
      
    NTLM is better because:
      More chars
      All cases
      
*
  Access token - Contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user, users group, the users privileges + other.
  
*
  Privileges - The right to perform system related operations e.g. shutdown.
    Applies to local computer
    Differs from access rights
    Stored in access token.
    
*
  Security descriptor - Data structure that contains security information associated with an object.
    Owner SID, Primary group SID, DACL, SACL.
    
*
  DACL - Discretionary access control list.
    Identifies who is allowed/denied access to object
    No DACL -> full control
    Empty DACL -> Denied.
    SID can be allowed/denied.
    Denies stored in beginning.
    List of access control entries (ACE).
    
    Search:
      Go through list until ALL requests is allowed, or ANY is denied, otherwise deny.
      
    Consequences:
      Deny has precedence before allow.
      
    Windows:
      User  -r
      Group rw ------> user rw
      
    Unix:
      User  -r
      Group rw ------> user -r
      
*
  SACL - System access control list.
    Specifying types of events that should generate audit records.
    
*
  Access control in networks:
    Users must go through two access control lists to access file via a share.
    1st share ACL 2nd file ACL
    Effective permission is A&B
    1010 & 1000 -> 1000
    
*
  Access control for restricted token:
    Group SID used for deny ONLY.
    Two access checks
      User
      Restricted token
    Both MUST allow.
    
9:

*
  General tracker to derive information from statistical databases:
    Tracker w/o specific target.
    TODO NOT DONE!!!!
    
10:

*
  Buffer overflow:
    Find buffer to overflow in a program.
    Write the exploit
      Inject code in buffer.
      Redirect control flow to code.
    Target stack or heap.
    
  Memory                  Stack
  --------------      /   ---------------
  |Kernel code  |   /     |Function     |
  |& data       |  /      |Parmeters    |
  ----------------        ---------------
  |Stack  |               |Return address
  |       V               ---------------
  ----------------        |Saved frame  |
  |Extra memory | \       |Pointer      |
  --------------    \     ---------------
  |       ^     |     \   |Local        |
  |Heap   |     |       \ |Variables    |
  --------------          |             |
  |Global data  |         ---------------
  --------------
  |Program      |
  |machine      |
  |code         |
  --------------


  How does it work?
    Copy a large buffer into a small buffer.
    If length is not checked, data will be overwritten.
    Strcpy() does not check.
    Will overwrite return address.
    If return address is outside process space, result in segmantation fault.
    If dangerous code within process space -> able to run.
    Prepend NOP when attacking other program to make the guess easier.

  Detection:
    Usage of Canary value between local variables and sfp.
    If changed -> terminate.
    Include option -fstack-protector in GCC

  Prevention:
    Do not use unsafe functions.
    Mark stack as non executable.
    Use address space layout randomization.
    Java instead of C or C++. (JVM can be written in C though).

*
  SQL-injections Code injection technique.
    By inserting malicous SQL statements into an entry field for execution.

    Ex. input: '; drop table users;--
      can result in SQL query:
        $QUERY=SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ''; drop table users;--';

    Prevention:
      Excape quotes.
      Check syntax using rewular expression.
      Turn off error reporting when not debugging.
      Use table and column names that are hard to guess.
      Name form fields different from columns.

11.1-11.2 & 12.1-12.3:

*
  Bell-LaPadula properties:
    ss-property - Simple security property.
      Mandatory access control
      No read-up: A user is not allowed read (observe) access to objects with higher security level.

    *-property - Star property.
      Mandatory access control.
      Does not apply to trusted subjects.
      No write down: A user is not allowed write (alter) access to objects with lower security level than the current level of subject.

    ds-property - 
      Discretionary access control.
      Subject may pass an access permission on to other users.
      Access rights given in access control matrix must also be followed.

*
  Tranquility in Bell-LaPadula
    Security levels and access rights never change.

*
  Biba difference from Bell
    Subject and objects mapped to integrity  levels forming a lattice.
    TODO NOT DONE DO NOT KNOW!!!!

*
  Integrity levels Biba
    Automatically adjusted.

    - Subject s read Object o at any integrity level.
      New integrity level of subject is the greatest lower bound of Fs(s) and Fo(o)

    - Subject s modify Object o at any integrity level.
      New integrity level of Object is the greatest lower bound of Fs(s) and Fo(o)
    

*
  Clark-Wilson focuses on integrity!

14:

*
  Empirically secure
    Secure based on the fact that no one has broken it for sometime.

  Provably secure
    We prove that breaking a scheme is at least as hard as breaking som well known problem like factoring or deiscrete log.

  Unconditionally secure
    The schemes are secure even if the adversary has unlimited computing power.

*
  Kerckhoff's principle
    Only the key should be unknown to an adversary.
      Security should not be based on the fact that an algorithm is secret.

*
  Stream ciphers and One time pads (OTP)
    Stream cipher
      Take a short random key and sxpand it to a long pseudorandom sequence of bits.

    OTP
      Different substitutions for every character

    "Stream cipher is a number of OTP that repeats"

*
  Stream cipher vs Block ciphers




*
  Block cipher modes
    ECB - Electric code book
      All blocks encrypted independently of eachother.
      Redundancy preserved.

    CBC - Cipher block chaining
      Redundancy removed.

    OFB - Output feedback
      Turns the block cipher into a stream cipher.

    TO BE CONTINUED!!!!!!!!!!
