3:

*
  Confidentiality -  Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information.
  Integrity - Prevent unauthorized modification of information.
  Availability - Prevent unauthorized with-holding of information and resources.
  Authentication - Act of confirming the truth of an entity, i.e. person/program.
  Nonrepudiation - A way to guarantee that a sender/reciever cannot deny having sent/receieved a message.
  Accountability - Users affecting security are held responsible.
  
*
  Data - Physical phenomena
  Information - What we assign to data
    Data is used to transit and store information.
    
4:

*
  Spoofing - A way to obtain password. Used when user does not authenticate system.
  E.g. false login screen.
  
*
  Brute force - Go through all possible passwords.
  Dictionary - Passwords are often based on words. Normal passwords stored in dictionaries.
  Time-Memory Tradeoff (TM TO) - In a way brute force. 
    Preprocessing phase, calculate hashes for number of passwords.
    Realtime phase, find hash in table, go to starting point -> password.
    
*
  Time-Memory Tradeoff - Pick password, calculate several reductions of hashes. Save start and end in table.
    T=t² P=N M=mt N=mt² -> N²=M²T P=N
    
*
  Rainbow tables - Improvement of TM TO. Use different reduction funtion for each computation. Fewer collisionchains. One table. Used when hash is known.
  
*
  Salts - Adds uniqueness to passwordhash
  
*
  Help from system - 
    Password checkers.
    Automatic password generation.
    Limit password time
    Limit Login attempts
    Show audit information
    
*
  Biometric systems - System that uses biological login information.
    FRR - False rejection rate
    FAR - False acceptance rate
    ERR - Equal error rate
    ERR -> FAR=FRR
    
5:

*
  Discretionary access control - The owner of an object decides the rights.
  Mandatory access control - The system decides the rights.
  
*
  Capabilities - List rights from user perspective
    Ex. Alice: A read, B read, C write.
    
  Access control list (ACL) - List rights from file perspective.
    Ex. A.txt: Alice read, Bob read.
    
*
  Powersets in access control - P(x) is the set of all the subsets in x, partial ordering. TODO NOT DONE!!
  
*
  Lattices - Graphical representation os a partially ordered set.
    Least upper bound u: a={x} b={y} u= {x,y}
    Greatest lower bound l: a={x,y} b={x,z} l={x}
    
*
  Reference monitor - Abstract machinery that controls all access to objects.
  Security kernel - The hardware, software etc. that implements the reference monitor concept.
  Trusted computing base (TCB) - The set of all protection mechanisms enforcing a security policy.

*
  Reference monitor:
  
                            -------
                            |Audit|

                          -----------
  A: Requests access
  B: Checks if subject has right to access object
  C: Writes to audit 
  D: Grants/Denies access
  
  
*
  Controlled invocation
    User wants to execute an operation requiring supervisor mode.
    Switch modes.
    System performs predefined sets of operations, returns to user mode, and gives back control.
    
*
  UID Unix:
    Real - ID of logged in principal, can only be changed by root -> How login works.
    Effective - ID used for access control. Root can change to anything. Anyone can change to real.
    
*
  Crypts
                    |  DES crypt         MD5 crypt         bcrypt
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Password length   |  Max 8 chars       Infinity          max 72 chars
  Salt length       |  12 bits           12-48 bits        128 bits
  Variable cost     |  No                No                Yes
  Evals/sec         |  1 000 000         10 000            450
  Conclusions       |  Fast                                Safe
  
*
  Shadow file - Save password in non-world readible file. Hide hashes.
    Username
    Hashed passwords
    Date of last change
    Min days between password change
    Max valid days
    Days in advance to warn about user change
    Days account is active after password expire
    Date of account disabling
    -Last entry is reserved-
    
*
  Access control in Unix - Discretionary access control, owner of file can change permissions.
    User - Group - Other
    Read - Write - Executable
    Read = List Directory.
    Write = Delete, rename & insert files in directory.
    Executable = Access directory ans access files in directory.
    CHMOD for changes (CHMOD 111 file.txt)
    
*
  Setuid - Set user ID, Used to temporarily change access rights.
  
*
  Inode - Stores file information. ls -i gives files with inode pointers
    Stat file gives detailed inode information.
    Size          Inode number
    Access rights
    Last access
    Last modification of file
    Last modification of inode
    
*
  UMASK - Default access rights.
    Control default permissions.
    UMASK tells which permissions to exclude by default.
    Opposite of CHMOD.
    
*
  Searchpaths - When executing programs, system needs to know where to look -> PATH
    PATH=.:$HOME/bin:/usr/bin:/bin.
    Trojan horse, if found first, executed instead of program.
    Current directory in searchpath, bad if executed by root.
    
*
  Hosts.Allow/Hosts.Deny - Files containing pairs to determine Allowed or Denied network access.
  Check Allow -> Check Deny -> Allow
  
8:

*
  LM & NTLM
    Problem w/ LM:
      DES is a fast block cipher
      No salt
      Security does not increase after 7 chars
      No lowercase
      
    NTLM is better beacause:
      More chars
      All cases
      
*
  Access token - Contains the security credentials fir a login session and identifies the user, users group, the users privileges + other.
  
*
  Privileges - The right to perform system related operations e.g. shutdown.
    Applies to local computer
    Differs from access rights
    Stored in access token.
    
*
  Security descriptor - Data structure that contains security information associated with an object.
    Owner SID, Primary group SID, DACL, SACL.
    
*
  DACL - Discretionary access control list.
    Identifies who is allowed/denied access to object
    No DACL -> full control
    Empty DACL -> Denied.
    SID can be allowed/denied.
    Denies stored in beginning.
    List of access control entries (ACE).
    
    Search:
      Go through list until ALL requests is allowed, or ANY is denied, otherwise deny.
      
    Consequences:
      Deny has precedence before allow.
      
    Windows:
      User  -r
      Group rw ------> user rw
      
    Unix:
      User  -r
      Group rw ------> user -r
      
*
  SACL - System access control list.
    Specifying types of events that should generate audit records.
    
*
  Access control in networks:
    Users must go through two access control lists to access file via a share.
    1st share ACL 2nd file ACL
    Effective permission is A&B
    1010 & 1000 -> 1000
    
*
  Access control for restricted token:
    Group SID used for deny ONLY.
    Two access checks
      User
      Restricted token
    Both MUST allow.
    
9:

*
  General tracker to derive information from statistical databases:
    Tracker w/o specific target.
    TODO NOT DONE!!!!
    
10:

*
  Buffer overflow:
    Find buffer to overflow in a program.
    Write the exploit
      Inject code in buffer.
      Redirect control flow to code.
    Target stack or heap.
